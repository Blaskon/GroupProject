<h1>Croke Park</h1>

<p class="crokep">
	Croke Park is said to be home to the GAA Sprots, before the purchace of the Stadiumin 1913, the space of 21 acres was owned by a private owner and was leased to different entreprenurs back in the 1829 for business use. But in 1894 a newly formed Company The City and Suburban Racecourse and Amusements Groiund Ltd purchased over 14 acres from the private owner and began renting the grounds for variety of sports.
	In the early years of the GAA All-Ireland Finals were played at a variety of venues around the country. The first finals played at what is now Croke Park took place in March 1896 with Tipperary successful in both codes, beating Kilkenny in the All-Ireland Hurling Final and Meath in the All-Ireland Football Final. By 1906 the City and Suburban Racecourse and Amusements Grounds Ltd. was in financial difficulty and was put up for auction. In the auctioneer’s advertisement the property was described as then consisting of 14 acres and 17 and a half perches’. A Frank Brazil Dineen decided to bid for the grounds and by a deed dated 1908 he paid £3,250 for the grounds.
	In 1913 Central Council decided to initiate the Croke Memorial Tournament to raise funds for a suitable monument to the GAA’s first patron, Archbishop Thomas Croke. The final of this tournament was played on 4th March 1913 with Kerry facing Louth. The attendance of 26,000 at the final surpassed all expectations and was the highest number to date at the venue. The game ended in a draw and the replay on 29th June was eagerly awaited. Such was the excitement that the three major Irish railway companies ran over 40 special trains to Dublin for the replay, carrying more than 20,000 passengers. Special stands were erected and voluntary stewards controlled the crowds.
