<h1>Kilmainham Gaol</h1>

<p class="kilmainham">
	Klimainham Gaol is a former prison in Ireland and is a must see place for people interested in history. Located just outside Dublin city center, Kilmainham Gaol is easily accessible by buses from the heart of the city center. KIlmainham Gaol was first built in 1796 and was called ‘New Gaol’. It was called this to separate it from the old prison called old gaol, which it was to take the place of. It was officially named County of Dublin Gaol.
<br>
<br>
 	Kilmainham Gaol imprisoned many Irish revolutionaries including leaders of the 1916 rising including Padraig Pearse and Eamon de Valera. Many prisoners from the 1916 rising where executed in the prison and leaders of the Irish nationlist where imprisoned here for over ten years.
<br>
	Kilmainham Gaol has also been used to film some famous films including The Italain Job (1969), In the Name of the Father (1993) and The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006). It was also used in the video of a U2 song called A Celebration.
