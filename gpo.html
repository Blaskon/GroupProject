		<h1>GPO</h1>

			<p class="g">
			The GPO The General Post Office (GPO; Irish: Ard-Oifig an Phoist) in Dublin is the headquarters of the Irish Post Office, 
			An Post, and Dublin's principal post office. Sited in the centre of O'Connell Street, the city's main thoroughfare, it is 
			one of Ireland's most famous buildings, and was the last of the great Georgian public buildings erected in the capital.
			<br><br>
			The GPO was at first located in a small building on the site of where the Commercial Buildings used to be (now the Central Bank building) 
			off Dame Street, and was afterwards removed to a larger house opposite the Bank of Ireland building on College Green. On 6 January 1818, 
			the new post-office in Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street) was opened for business. The foundation-stone of the building,
			which is built after a design of Francis Johnston, was laid by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Charles Whitworth, 1st Earl Whitworth, 
			on 12 August 1814, attended by the Post-Masters-General, Charles O'Neill, 1st Earl O'Neill and Laurence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse.
			The main section of the building was made with Wicklow granite and the portico of Portland stone. 
			The structure was completed in the short space of three years for the sum of Â£50,000.
			<br><br>	

    		It was the main stronghold of the Irish Volunteers in the 1916 Rising, while today the General Post Office offers a wide range of services.
