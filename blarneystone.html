<h1>Blarney Stone</h1>

<p class="blarney">
	The Blarney Stone attracts tourists from all over the world. The Blarney Stone is a Carboniferous limestone block, which is built into the battlements of Blarney Castle. Blarney Castle is located about five miles outside of cork. The castle was built in 1446. Kissing the stone is meant to give you the gift of the gab.
<br><br>
	Kissing the stone isnâ€™t as straight forward as you might think. With the assistance of a worker you have to lay on your back, hold on to the bars and reach out with your head and kiss the stone. 
<br><br>	
	The castle is built on the edge of a cliff and is the third to have been built on this site. It was by Dermot McCarthy, King of Munster.
