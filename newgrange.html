	The earliest surviving art in Ireland can be traced to the Neolithic period. These are the passage graves that are situated on the bend of the river Boyne consisting of Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth. A Passage grave is a corridor of vertical stone slabs called orthostats with other slabs resting on top to form a roof, this leads to a chamber which is also constructed of stone. This structure is buried beneath an artificial hill called a tumulus or cairn. Many of the huge stone slabs that make up the construction of these passage graves have decorations carved on them consisting of zigzags, spirals, lozenges and circles carved using mostly a flint chisel and stone hammer. The most impressive passage grave in Ireland is Newgrange.
	Newgrange is one of the best examples in Ireland and in Western Europe, of a type of monument known to archaeologists as a passage-grave or passage-tomb. It was constructed around 3200BC, according to the most reliable Carbon 14 dates available from archaeology. This makes it more than 600 years older than the Giza Pyramids in Egypt, and 1,000 years more ancient than Stonehenge.
	Its is one of the biggest tourist attraction , a beauty that has people wondering and asking questions about the history behind it all.
=======
	Newgrange is a prehistoric monument in County Meath. It was built during the Neolithic Period around 3200 BC. Newgrange is a large mound that measures 76 meters across and 12 meters high and covers 4,500 square meters of ground.  It’s circular in shape and made of layers of earth and stone, with a grass growing on top. It’s surrounded with large cobbles.	
<br><br>
	It is still not clear exactly what it was used for but it is thought to be of religious significance. It’s most famous for the way it is aligned with the rising sun. The sun shines down the chamber on the 21st of december also known as winter solstice, which is the shortest day and longest night of the year. There is only one way in and one way out and this is through a narrow passage.  At the end of the passage there are three small chambers of a large chamber with a high roof. Each of these has a large flat “basin stone” Inside the chambers there is a lot of craved artwork in the rocks.
<br><br>	
	To gain access to Newgrange you must only do so as part of tour. The tour starts at the Bru na Boinne Visitor Center.
